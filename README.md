# Boolean Benchmark Builder 

## About 

Boolean Benchmark Builder is a C++ tool to enable the automatic generation of Boolean function benchmarks. Boolean function benchmarks are used to evaluate and analyze methods that are applied to program synthesis and evolvable hardware. The motivation for the development of the Boolean Benchmark Builder was the proposal and evaluation of two advanced phenotypic operators, called duplication and inversion, for the Genetic Programming variant Cartesian Genetic Programming. The Boolean Benchmark Builder was used to generate the truth table of the arithmetic logical unit benchmark. This benchmark is described in the corresponding publication of this work (see reference below). 

## Cartesian Genetic Programming 

Genetic programming is a heuristic method inspired by neo-Darwinian evolution for commonly used for program synthesis. Cartesian Genetic Programming is a variant of Genetic Programming which uses a graph representation model. Cartesian Genetic Programming is predominantly applied to the synthesis of Boolean programs and evolvable hardware.
